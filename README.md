# Network-Analyses-of-Quarantined-Friendship-Networks
The Covid-19 Pandemic has essentially put a stop to the whole world. In a time where human interaction can be potentially lethal, social ties have been disrupted like never before.
With countries under lockdown, most people have been quarantined at their homes and their only connection with the outside world is through technology and social media. 

Under such trying times, university students throughout the world have undergone suffering in not only their studies but also their support networks.
In this report, we will analyze the friendship network of a Liberal Arts College and try to create a pseudo network based on their social ties in quarantine. 
After getting survey results of 300 students from Habib University and linking the individuals based on whether they have turned to the same coping mechanism in such crisis or not, 
we try to find out whether small world characteristics can be visualized in our pseudo network or not.

We start off by summarising the four famous small world networks i.e. Erdos-Renyi, Watt Strogatz, Jon Kleinberg and Barbarasi-Albert models.
We then move on to show our findings from the survey and build pesuodo networks to study the small world effect in them. 
We will explore how the social ties have formed in the support network of the students due to the mandatory quarantine caused by the Covid-19 Pandemic. 
We will then go on to study the mediums through which the changes, if any, have occurred.
